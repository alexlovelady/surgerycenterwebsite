            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, leading to unintentional urine leakage. Surgical treatment options include sling procedures, bladder neck suspension, and artificial urinary sphincter implantation. These procedures aim to support the urethra and improve bladder control.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients will undergo a thorough evaluation, including urodynamic studies and possibly cystoscopy. Pre-operative instructions may include avoiding certain medications and fasting before surgery.</p>
    
        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgical procedure varies based on the type of incontinence. Sling procedures involve placing a mesh or tissue sling to support the urethra. Bladder neck suspension lifts and secures the bladder neck. An artificial urinary sphincter is implanted to provide control over urinary flow.</p>
    
        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>Post-operative care includes monitoring for urinary retention, infection, and ensuring proper function of any implanted devices. Patients may need to follow specific instructions regarding physical activity and catheter use during the recovery period.</p>
