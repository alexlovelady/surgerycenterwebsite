        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to remove the gallbladder. It is most commonly performed to treat gallstones and gallbladder inflammation. The procedure involves making several small incisions in the abdomen through which a laparoscope and surgical instruments are inserted to remove the gallbladder.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients are advised to fast for at least 8 hours before the procedure. Pre-surgical testing may include blood work and imaging studies. You will need to arrange for someone to drive you home after the surgery.</p>

        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. Small incisions are made in the abdomen, and the gallbladder is removed through one of these incisions. The incisions are then closed with sutures or surgical tape.</p>

        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>After the procedure, patients are monitored in a recovery area before being discharged. Pain and discomfort are usually mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication. A follow-up appointment is usually scheduled within a week to check the incisions and recovery progress.</p>
