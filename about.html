                <h3>Dr. Kent Sasse</h3>
                <p>Bariatric Surgeon</p>
                <p>Dr. Sasse grew up in Wisconsin, the youngest of two boys, and he attended Spanish-speaking schools in Central America for a part of high school and learned Spanish. He witnessed poverty but also witnessed the profound impact one can make in the lives of others through caring and service.

                    He was interested in a number of subjects in high school but especially math and science. He felt drawn to Medicine as a career from a young age, seeing it as an opportunity to blend his interest in science with his desire to serve others. He played junior tennis competitively and was captain of his high school tennis team and a high school All-American.
