    <p>The entire staff is helpful and caring. I have always been greeted with a smile when I walk in. Dr. Nairizi is compassionate and extremely knowledgeable. During my procedures, my comfort is a top priority for him. I am appreciative of him listening to me and acknowledging that I do not want pain medications and creating my treatment plan around that."</p>

    <p>I have been with Dr. Nairizi for years now. I would follow him anywhere. He has literally saved my life in more ways than I could even say. He helped me get off all the medications I was on. My Drs. In the past would just keep uppering my meds to where I felt like a zombie. I couldn't do anything for years. I recently had a Spinal Cord Stimulator put into my lower back and WOW what a difference. It has taken away 100%of the pain in my lower back. I so wish I would have found Dr. Nairizi years ago. I lost so many years with my family. I have also lost 60 pounds seeing him.This was the best thing I have ever done for myself. Anyone out there with pain, please see Dr. Nairizi. He does really care and his whole staff are approachable and so nice all the time."</p>
