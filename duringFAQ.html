                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Should I take my usual daily medication?</b>
                    <br>We typically recommend that you take your daily medication before leaving home. Diabetic medications, however, will be tailored to each patient. In most cases, we hold diabetic medications and manage your blood sugar at the Center. You should be contacted prior to surgery to ensure you know exactly which medications to take. 
                    <u>Please bring all of your medications with you.</u>

                    <br><br>Certain medications, particularly diabetes medication and blood thinners, will need to be paused for the surgery. 
                    <u>Make sure to bring these medications and/or inhalers with you on the day of your procedure.</u> Please reach out with any questions you may have.

                    <br><br><b>May I continue my herbal medications?</b>
                    <br>Herbal medications can sometimes have adverse effects during surgery. Many of these remedies can affect blood clotting or interact with anesthetic agents. (The list of potential drugs and side effects is too extensive for this site.) We generally ask that you stop taking herbal medications two weeks before surgery. Please be sure to mention any herbal remedies when asked about your medications.

                    <br><br><b>Who may accompany me?</b>
                    <br>We welcome one person to accompany you to the Center. They will be allowed to stay with you in your room before surgery and may sit with you afterward, should you choose.

                    <br><br>For children undergoing surgery, it is common for two parents and/or guardians to accompany them to the Center. While we will try our best to accommodate everyone, only one parent and/or guardian will be permitted into the recovery room at a time.

                    <br>We kindly ask that young children not be brought to the Center as guests.

                    <br><br><b>Will I receive sedation before going into the operating room?</b>
                    <br>Your care will be personalized, and sedation will be administered based on individual needs.
