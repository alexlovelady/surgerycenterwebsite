            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Bariatric surgery refers to a variety of weight-loss procedures performed on people who have obesity. These procedures include gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding, among others. The goal of bariatric surgery is to help patients lose weight by making changes to the digestive system, often by reducing the size of the stomach.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients are required to follow a special diet before surgery and may need to lose a certain amount of weight. Pre-surgical evaluations typically include nutritional counseling, psychological assessment, and medical clearance.</p>
    
        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and can take 1 to 3 hours depending on the specific procedure. The stomach is either reduced in size or rerouted to decrease food intake and absorption. The procedure may be performed laparoscopically, with small incisions.</p>
    
        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>After the surgery, patients are monitored in the hospital for 1-3 days. A strict post-operative diet is followed, starting with liquids and gradually transitioning to solid foods. Long-term follow-up care is essential for monitoring weight loss and nutritional intake.</p>
