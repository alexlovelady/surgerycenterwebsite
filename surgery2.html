        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that allows doctors to view the knee joint without making a large incision through the skin and other soft tissues. It is commonly used to diagnose and treat a variety of knee problems, including torn meniscus, damaged cartilage, and inflamed joint linings.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients should stop taking certain medications, such as blood thinners, a few days before surgery. Fasting is required 8 hours before the procedure. Arrangements should be made for someone to take you home after surgery.</p>

        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgery is typically performed under regional or general anesthesia. Small incisions are made around the knee, and a camera (arthroscope) is inserted to guide the surgery. Depending on the findings, the surgeon may repair or remove damaged tissue.</p>

        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>Post-operative care involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) to manage swelling and pain. Physical therapy may be recommended to help restore knee function. Follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor your recovery.</p>
