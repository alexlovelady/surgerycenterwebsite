        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) is a type of heart surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. Surgeons use CABG to treat people with severe coronary artery disease (CAD), a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients will undergo pre-surgical testing, including blood tests, X-rays, and an electrocardiogram (EKG). It is important to follow the surgeonâ€™s instructions regarding medications and fasting before the procedure. Arrangements should be made for a lengthy recovery period at home.</p>

        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and typically takes 3 to 6 hours. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses the blocked portion of the coronary artery, creating a new path for blood to flow to the heart.</p>

        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>After surgery, patients will spend several days in the hospital for monitoring and recovery. Pain management, wound care, and physical activity will be closely managed. Cardiac rehabilitation may be recommended to help with recovery and to prevent future heart issues.</p>
