            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements, leading to unintentional stool leakage. Treatment options range from non-surgical methods like dietary changes and pelvic floor exercises to surgical interventions such as sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, or artificial bowel sphincter placement.</p>

            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fecal incontinence affects about 18 million adults in the United States.</li>
                <li>Sphincteroplasty has a success rate of 70-80% in patients with sphincter damage.</li>
                <li>Sacral nerve stimulation is effective in reducing incontinence episodes in up to 90% of patients.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Patients may need to undergo diagnostic tests such as anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound. Pre-operative instructions include bowel preparation and fasting before surgery.</p>
    
        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgical approach depends on the cause of incontinence. Sphincteroplasty involves repairing the damaged anal sphincter. Sacral nerve stimulation involves implanting a device that modulates nerve signals to improve bowel control.</p>
    
        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>After surgery, patients are monitored for bowel function and potential complications. Long-term follow-up includes monitoring the function of any implanted devices and possibly continuing pelvic floor therapy.</p>
