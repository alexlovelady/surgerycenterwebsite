        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        
        <h3>Pre-Operative Instructions</h3>
        <p>Prior to surgery, patients will undergo a consultation to discuss their goals, choose the appropriate type and size of implants, and review the surgical plan. It is important to stop smoking and avoid certain medications before surgery to reduce the risk of complications.</p>

        <h3>The Procedure</h3>
        <p>The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours. Incisions are made in inconspicuous areas to minimize visible scarring. The surgeon places the implants either under the chest muscle or directly behind the breast tissue, depending on the desired outcome.</p>

        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
        <p>After surgery, patients are advised to wear a supportive surgical bra to help minimize swelling and support the healing breasts. Pain and discomfort are usually managed with prescribed medications. Follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor recovery and ensure optimal results.</p>
